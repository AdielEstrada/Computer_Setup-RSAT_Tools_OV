## Setting Up A Static IP Address in Server Environment
We will be setting up a static IP address in the server because it will be easier for this server to be discoverable by the devices that we will be setting up. Not only that, but I didn't buy a domain. If this were to be a real environmnent, there could be legal issues, since I don't own the domain "adielit.local". So, to do this, open control panel from the start menu or through the search bar.

Under network, go to "View Network Status and Tasks". We will be looking for an option called "Change Adapter Settings".
